# Metro-Operations-Optimization-using-Python

Metro Operations Optimization refers to the systematic process of enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of Metro services through various data-driven techniques and operational adjustments. So, if you want to learn how to optimize the operations of a service like Metro using data-driven techniques, this article is for you. In this article, Iâ€™ll take you through the task of Metro Operations Optimization using Python.


Metro Operations Optimization: Getting Started

The problem I am working on in this article is my take on a problem statement I found at statso. The dataset contains several files, as follows:

   1. Agency: Information about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact details.
   2. Calendar: Service schedules delineating the operation days (weekdays, weekends) and valid dates for these schedules.
   3. Routes: Details of metro routes, including short and long names, type of route, and descriptions.
   4. Shapes: Geographical coordinates of routes, providing the precise paths taken by the metro lines.
   5. Stop Times: Timetables for each trip indicating arrival and departure times at specific stops.
   6. Stops: Locations of metro stops, including latitude and longitude coordinates.
   7. Trips: Information linking trips to routes, including details like trip identifiers and associated route IDs.
